<p align="center"> <i> I haven't made a preview yet, so here's a fox for u </i> </p>

## Installation

- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/miamoremustachio/kisunka/releases/latest) and download the project source
- Put the `chrome` folder into your Firefox profile directory
  - go to `about:support` > **Profile directory** > **Open Folder**
- go to `about:config`
- Set these variables:
  - `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` > `true`
  - `widget.windows.mica` > `true`
  - `widget.windows.mica.toplevel-backdrop` > `2`
- Turn on vertical tabs *(that's important!!)*
- Restart Firefox and enjoy your neko vibes :tea:

> :fish_cake: **Note:** Mica-related variables works only on Windows 11.
>
> If you don't see any effect after setting them up as described above, try switching to the **System theme ‚Äî auto** in `about:addons`

***
For the sassiest transbian-gradient home page:

- Download [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/)
- :gear: > scroll to the bottom > **Import**
- Select `tabliss.json` from the project root

*There's a chance though that your kitty will be soaring on their fart-powered missile: it's up to you to set the silly back on their place using tabliss' Display Settings or let 'em fly :rocket:*

***
I also highly recommend to use [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass) with this theme for maximum background blurrrness :sparkles:

To set it up:
- Dowload .zip from the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass/releases)
- Unzip it anywhere on `C:/` drive
<details><summary><b>- Run the `DWMBlurGlass.exe` and click Install</b></summary>
If nothing happens when you click Install, then you need to click on the Symbols page and click Download
<details>
- Youre golden :nail_care:
